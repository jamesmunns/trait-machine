# Trait Machine

A proof of concept of declaring a state machine that exists simultaneously on two separate devices.

Basically, this seems useful when the "state machine" is phase locked across two devices: they always move in lockstep with each other, but might do different things at the transitions.

I dunno if this is practically useful, but I think it is very neat.
